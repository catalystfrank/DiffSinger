### Dataset information and preprocessing

#### binarization_args shuffle

Whether binarized dataset is shuffled or not.

##### used by

all

##### type

boolean

##### default

true

#### augmentation_args random_pitch_shifting range

Data will be augmented by random pitch shifting, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

When range is set to [-M,N], data's f0 will be shifted in th range of f0 - M semitones to f0 + N semitones.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[-5,5]

#### augmentation_args random_pitch_shifting scale

Data will be augmented by random pitch shifting, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

When scale is set to s, extra s times of orignal dataset total length will be added to the total datase after augmentation. 

##### used by

all

##### type

float

##### default

1.0

#### augmentation_args fixed_pitch_shifting targets

Data will be augmented by fixed pitch shifting, shifted data will NOT be seen as the original speaker.

For each target t in the list, data's f0 of certain speaker will be shifted to f0 + t semitones as a  different speaker.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[-5,5]

#### augmentation_args fixed_pitch_shifting scale

Data will be augmented by fixed pitch shifting, shifted data will NOT be seen as the original speaker.

When scale is set to s, extra s times of orignal dataset total length will be added to the total datase after augmentation. 

##### used by

all

##### type

float

##### default

0.75

#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching range

Data will be augmented by random time stretching, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

Random values will be sampled from the range [M, N]. Lower values means speeding up, higher values means slowing down.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[0.5,2]

#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching domain

Data will be augmented by random time stretching, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

Random values will be sampled from the range. 

##### used by

all

##### type

str

##### default

log

##### constraint

Choose from ['log','linear']


#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching scale

Data will be augmented by fixed pitch shifting, shifted data will NOT be seen as the original speaker.

When scale is set to s, extra s times of orignal dataset total length will be added to the total datase after augmentation. 

##### used by

all

##### type

##### default

0.75



#### raw_data_dir

Path(s) to the raw data including wave files, transcriptions, etc.

##### used by

all

##### type

str, List[str]

### Training, validation and inference

#### task_cls

TBD

#### lr

Initial learning rate of the scheduler.

##### used by

all

##### type

float

##### default

_0.0004_

#### max_batch_size

Number of .wav slices in each data batch sent from dataloader to each single GPU.

This number will be kept the same unless max_batch_frames requirement is not met. In this case, per card batch size will be automatically reduced to a feasible size to get rid of OOM.

##### used by

all

##### type

int

##### default

_48_

#### max_batch_frames

$\text{1 time frame} =\frac{\text{hop size}}{\text{Wav file sample rate}} \text{ second(s)}$.

Number of time frames in per card batch is not allowed to exceed max_batch_frames to get rid of OOM. max_batch_size will be automatically reduced to meet this requirement.

##### used by

all

##### type

int

##### default

_80000_
