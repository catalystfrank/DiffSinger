### Dataset information and preprocessing

#### binarization_args shuffle

Whether binarized dataset is shuffled or not.

##### used by

all

##### type

boolean

##### default

true

#### augmentation_args random_pitch_shifting range

Data will be augmented by random pitch shifting, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

When range is set to [-M,N], data's f0 will be shifted in th range of f0 - M semitones to f0 + N semitones.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[_-5_,_5_]

#### augmentation_args random_pitch_shifting scale

Data will be augmented by random pitch shifting, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

When scale is set to s, extra s times of orignal dataset total length will be added to the total dataset after augmentation. 

##### used by

all

##### type

float

##### default

_1.0_

#### augmentation_args fixed_pitch_shifting targets

Data will be augmented by fixed pitch shifting, shifted data will NOT be seen as the original speaker.

For each target t in the list, data's f0 of certain speaker will be shifted to f0 + t semitones as a  different speaker.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[_-5_,_5_]

#### augmentation_args fixed_pitch_shifting scale

Data will be augmented by fixed pitch shifting, shifted data will NOT be seen as the original speaker.

When scale is set to s, extra s times of orignal dataset total length will be added to the total dataset after augmentation. 

##### used by

all

##### type

float

##### default

_0.75_

#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching range

Data will be augmented by random time stretching, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

Random values will be sampled from the range [M, N]. Lower values means speeding up, higher values means slowing down.

##### used by

all

##### type

list[float]

##### default

[_0.5_,_2_]

#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching domain

Data will be augmented by random time stretching, shifted data will be seen as the original speaker.

Random values will be sampled from the range:

- If 'linear', stretching ratio will be uniformly drawn from [M,N].
- If 'log', x will be uniformly drawn from [log(M),log(N)] then stretching ratio will be set as $\text{e}^{\text{x}}$

str

##### default

log

##### constraint

Choose from [_'log'_,_'linear'_]


#### augmentation_args random_time_stretching scale

#### lr_decay_gamma

TBD

#### max_batch_frames

$\text{1 time frame} =\frac{\text{hop size}}{\text{Wav file sample rate}} \text{ second(s)}$.

Number of time frames in per card batch is not allowed to exceed max_batch_frames to get rid of OOM. max_batch_size will be automatically reduced to meet this requirement.

##### used by

all

##### type

int

##### default

_80000_

#### max_batch_size

Number of .wav slices in each data batch sent from dataloader to each single GPU.

This number will be kept the same unless max_batch_frames requirement is not met. In this case, per card batch size will be automatically reduced to a feasible size to get rid of OOM.
